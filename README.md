## Description
Managing complex state with `useState` in React involves creating multiple state variables for each aspect of the applicationâ€™s data, which might require updates across various parts of a component. For example, in a form with multiple fields, each field's state can be managed with separate `useState` hooks. Alternatively, a single `useState` hook can hold an object or array to manage related data, with careful use of spread syntax (`...`) to ensure immutability when updating individual properties within the state.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
